For example, we can see that it took the United States about 2 weeks to vaccindate 1 percent of their total population, which was about 363 thousand individuals. From then it took our country abour a month to break the 10 percent marker of total population vaccinated. This was over 34 million indiviudals. The table shows that within a month and a half, the country was able to provide over 34 million indiviudals with the highly demanded vaccine, showing that had a decent system considering the constraints that had to be met, such as deadlines, limited resources, and so on."
